                    <p class="p-text">I am a <b>B.Tech Second Year Student</b> of National Institute of Technology, Silchar, pursuing my degree in <b>Electronics and Communication Engineering</b>. I have a keen interest in Problem Solving and Finding new and Dynamic Ideas.</p>
                    <p class="p-text">I am a skilled and enthusiastic <b>web developer in training</b> with over <b>2 years of hands-on experience</b> in HTML. I am currently expanding my expertise in
                        <b>CSS and JavaScript</b>, working diligently to master these essential web development technologies. My experience includes assisting professors
                        in creating a dynamic and responsive website, along with conducting several experimental projects to hone my skills.</p>
